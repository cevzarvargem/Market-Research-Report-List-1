<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Latches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>D-Type</li><li>SR- Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Latches are basic memory storage elements used in digital circuits to hold a state. The D-Type latch captures input data (D) on a clock signal's edge, ensuring data stability. In contrast, the SR-Type latch uses Set (S) and Reset (R) inputs to control its state, allowing for more flexible operations. Both types retain their value until a change occurs, making them essential in building temporary memory and synchronizing signals in digital devices.</p></p>
