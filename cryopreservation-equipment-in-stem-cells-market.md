<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cryopreservation Equipment in Stem Cells Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Phase</li><li>Vapor Phase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cryopreservation equipment in the stem cell market primarily includes liquid phase and vapor phase systems. Liquid phase cryopreservation involves storing biological samples directly in liquid nitrogen at extremely low temperatures, ensuring maximum viability. In contrast, vapor phase systems use the gaseous form of nitrogen above the liquid level, providing a layer of insulation while still maintaining low temperatures. Both methods are critical for preserving stem cells' functionality and integrity for research, therapies, and regenerative medicine applications.</p></p>
