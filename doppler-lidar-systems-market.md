<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Doppler LiDAR Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pulse</li><li>Continuous Wave</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Doppler LiDAR systems are classified into two main types: pulse and continuous wave (CW). Pulse LiDAR emits short bursts of light and measures the time it takes for the reflection to return, enabling precise distance and velocity measurements. In contrast, continuous wave LiDAR emits a constant beam of light, analyzing frequency shifts due to the Doppler effect to determine velocity. Both types are widely used in applications like autonomous vehicles, atmospheric research, and industrial monitoring, each offering specific advantages in data acquisition and processing.</p></p>
