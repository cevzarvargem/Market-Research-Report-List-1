<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mobile Blood Glucose Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Glucose Oxidase Method</li><li>Glucose Dehydrogenase Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mobile blood glucose meter market features two primary types: the glucose oxidase method and the glucose dehydrogenase method. The glucose oxidase method relies on an enzymatic reaction that uses glucose oxidase to convert glucose into gluconic acid, producing hydrogen peroxide, which is measured for glucose levels. In contrast, the glucose dehydrogenase method employs NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) as a coenzyme, facilitating the oxidation of glucose, and providing a more accurate reading with reduced interference from other sugars. Both methods serve diabetes management by offering convenient, portable blood glucose monitoring.</p></p>
